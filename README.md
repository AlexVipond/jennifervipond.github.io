# Vipond for Congress
Dr. Jennifer Hoppe Vipond's website for her 2018 Congressional Campaign

## Purpose
As you may have guessed, [vipondforcongress.com](https://vipondforcongress.com) was built to help Dr. Vipond tell the residents of Wisconsin's 5th District why she wants to represent them in Congress, and why they should vote for her. But that's not the website's _only_ purpose.

[Vipondforcongress.com](https://vipondforcongress.com) is an example of how political candidates, elected officials, and government agencies _can_ create an online presence that is informative, well-designed, functional, secure, and accessible to everyone. This can and should be done without spending taxpayer dollars on large, indifferent IT companies or on technologies that are expensive, difficult to set up, or difficult to maintain.

Dr. Vipond's team of independent designers and developers accomplished the goals of [vipondforcongress.com](https://vipondforcongress.com) using technology that is almost completely free and open source, and they published the source code here on Github for the general public to see and reuse.
