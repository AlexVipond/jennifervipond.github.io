# Vipond for Congress
Dr. Jennifer Vipond's website for her 2018 Congressional Campaign

## Purpose
As you may have guessed, this website was built to help Dr. Vipond tell the residents of Wisconsin's 5th District why she wants to represent them in Congress, and why they should vote for her. But that's not the website's _only_ purpose.

Dr. Vipond built [vipondforcongress.com](https://vipondforcongress.com) with a fairly compensated team of designers and developers, using technology that is almost completely free and open source, and she published the source code here on Github for the general public to see and reuse. The website is mobile-responsive, and it scores highly on audits for performance, accessibility, and best practices in web design.

In other words, [vipondforcongress.com](https://vipondforcongress.com) is Dr. Vipond's way of saying that political candidates, elected officials, and government agencies _can_ and _should_ use and create online tools that are functional, informative, well-designed, and accessible to everyone. This can and should be done without spending taxpayer dollars on large, indifferent IT companies or on technologies that are expensive, difficult to set up, or difficult to maintain.

## Technology
The technology stack used to create and maintain [vipondforcongress.com](https://vipondforcongress.com) is:
- Atom (text editor)
- HTML, CSS, and Javascript (basic design and functionality)
- Github (version control)
- Donorbox and Stripe (secure online donations)
- SimpleForm (email subscription form)
- Jekyll (static site generation)
- Github Pages (hosting)
- Prose.io (content editing)
- Mail for Good (email marketing)
