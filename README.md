# Vipond for Congress
### Dr. Jennifer Vipond's website for her 2018 Congressional Campaign

---

## Purpose
As you may have guessed, this website was built to help Dr. Vipond tell the residents of Wisconsin's 5th District why she wants to represent them in Congress, and why they should vote for her.

But that's not the website's _only_ purpose.

Dr. Vipond built [vipondforcongress.com](https://vipondforcongress.com) with a fairly compensated team of designers and developers, using technology that is almost all free and open source, and she [published the source code](https://github.com/jennifervipond/vipondforcongress) for all to see (and reuse, if they so choose).

In other words, [vipondforcongress.com](https://vipondforcongress.com) is Dr. Vipond's way of demonstrating that political candidates, elected officials, and government agencies _can_ use and create online tools that are functional, informative, accessible, and well-designed. Moreover, this can be done this _without_ spending taxpayer dollars on large, indifferent IT companies or on technologies that are either expensive, difficult to set up, difficult to maintain, or all of the above.
