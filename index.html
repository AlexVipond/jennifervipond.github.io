        <h2>Common Sense Leadership</h2>

        <!-- <p>My name is Dr. Jennifer Hoppe Vipond, and I am running to represent Wisconsin’s fifth congressional district in the United States House of Representatives.</p>
        <p>For over twenty-five years I have had the privilege to serve the people of District 5 as a pediatrician. I have worked with thousands of families and been a part of their struggles and their successes. I was born and raised in this district, and I have raised six children here while maintaining a full time medical practice.</p>
        <p>Congress has become a dysfunctional body divided into two groups that refuse to agree on even the most obvious issues. I would like to bring back a Congress where common sense is more important than special interests and where evidence-based policymaking replaces fearmongering and divisiveness.</p>
        <p>Lasting reform will only be accomplished with bipartisan agreements, and it is time to grow up and work together to solve the problems that are impacting so many American families.</p>
        <p>As a pediatrician, I have worked hard to address today’s issues in order to assure the best possible tomorrow. In Congress, I will do the same.</p> -->

        <h2>The Challenge of Medical Care</h2>
        <h3>As a physician, I have seen how much waste we tolerate in medicine.</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraphs" style="text-align: left;">
        <p>In twenty-five years, I have seen drastic changes in our system of medical care. The costs have skyrocketed, making care increasingly less affordable for American families. Every year, the average middle class family is spending a greater percentage of their income on healthcare costs.</p>
        <p>While Congress has battled over strategies to pay for the crippling costs of medical care, little has been done to reign in the exponential increases we are seeing. If we don’t control the rise in cost, it will not matter if we have a single payer system or free market insurance&mdash;America will not be able to afford it.</p>
        <p>I am running for Congress because I would like to work on strategies to control healthcare costs. As a physician, I have seen how much waste we tolerate in medicine. Complicated billing systems requiring multiple administrative layers, uncontrolled prescription drug costs, duplication of services, and fraud all increase price without improving patient outcomes.</p>
        <p>Until these issues are resolved, medical costs will continue to rise, and Americans will be stuck with the bill.</p>

        <h2>The Second Amendment</h2>
        <h3>I will work to loosen the restrictions on gun violence research.</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraphs" style="text-align: left;">
        <p>Gun violence is a major problem in our district. Enforcement of our current gun laws is the first step in improving the safety of the residents of our district. The Second Amendment guarantees our right to bear arms, but common sense dictates that gun ownership should be restricted to only those people who are legally eligible to own guns.</p>
        <p>By researching automobile accidents, American engineers have made huge progress in making our cars safer and in reducing automobile related deaths and injuries. We have all benefited. The same approach can help reduce gun violence.</p>
        <p>I will work to loosen the restrictions on gun violence research.</p>
