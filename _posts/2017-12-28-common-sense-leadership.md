My name is Dr. Jennifer Hoppe Vipond, and I am running to represent Wisconsin’s fifth congressional district in the United States House of Representatives.

For over twenty-five years I have had the privilege to serve the people of District 5 as a pediatrician. I have worked with thousands of families and been a part of their struggles and their successes. I was born and raised in this district, and I have raised six children here while maintaining a full time medical practice.

Congress has become a dysfunctional body divided into two groups who refuse to agree on even the most obvious issues. I would like to bring back a Congress where common sense is more important than special interests and where evidence-based policymaking replaces fearmongering and divisiveness.

Lasting reform will only be accomplished with bipartisan agreements, and it is time to grow up and work together to solve the problems that are impacting so many American families.

As a pediatrician, I have worked hard to address today’s issues in order to assure the best possible tomorrow. In Congress, I will do the same.
