Gun violence is a major problem in our district. Enforcement of our current gun laws is the first step in improving the safety of the residents of our district. The Second Amendment guarantees our right to bear arms, but real life experience dictates that gun ownership should be restricted to only those people who are legally eligible to own guns.

Gun violence continues to be a major problem in our country and few Americans have been unaffected. There have been two mass shootings within two miles of my home. My oldest son sheltered in place during the June 2017 shooting in Virginia that injured Congressman Steve Scalise and three other people.  Enforcement of our current gun laws is the first step in improving the safety of the residents of our district but, as we saw in the February 14th 2018 shooting in Parkland, Florida, the current laws are inadequate. Despite a long history of mental health problems and multiple interactions with local law enforcement, the shooter was able to legally purchase an AR-15 semiautomatic weapon with multiple magazines.

Seventeen year old Parkland student David Hogg said it best, "We are children. You guys are, like, the adults. Take action, work together, come over your politics, and get something done".

I understand the right to own a gun. I also understand the right to go to school, to go to the movies, to go to a concert venue, to play a game of baseball, to attend a church service, to go to the mall, to get a haircut, to go to a nightclub, to attend college, to go to work, _to finish first grade_.

>I will protect the legal ownership of guns.

Mental health issues are a contributor to most of these mass shootings. The party line seems to be that we don't need more gun restrictions, we just need to address the mental health problems in our society. If only it were that easy. I can tell you from years of experience that there is no miracle solution for most mental health problems. We cannot identify a mentally ill person and wave a magic wand or give a wonder drug and expect that they will be instantly cured. Treatment takes time and relapses are common.

In the meantime we need to remove access to guns, especially the semiautomatic rifles that have proven so deadly.

Most mentally ill people will never pick up a gun, but there are established warning signs that indicate higher risk of violence. We need laws to keep guns out of the hands of those people.

By researching automobile accidents, American engineers have made huge progress in making our cars safer and in reducing automobile related deaths and injuries. We have all benefited. The same approach could help reduce gun violence, but since 1996 the Centers for Disease Control has been unable to fund research that could help make guns safer.  Guns could be made theft resistant and child resistant without interfering with the rights of gun owners.

I will work to loosen the restrictions on gun research in order to decrease gun related deaths.
