2017 saw the emergence of a new strength in women across the United States. In 2018 and beyond I hope to see this strength continue to grow so that our daughters as well as our sons will have the opportunity to maximize their potential without fear or false limitations.  In order to make this happen we need to ensure access to birth control to allow young women to complete their education and choose if and when they wish to start a family. I believe that abortion is a tragedy, but I know the best way to prevent abortion is to prevent unwanted pregnancies. With the contraceptive methods available today unwanted pregnancy in a consenting woman should be a rarity. Unwanted pregnancies are usually the result of a lack of access to basic preventive care. The best way to reduce the number of abortions is to provide comprehensive womenâ€™s health services including family planning and contraception. It is crucial that any health plan put forward include these basic services.

In order to become successful and self-reliant citizens, women need control of their fertility. We all want fewer people to be relying on government aid. Strong women will in turn lead to strong families and better opportunities for the next generation.

>Strong women will in turn lead to strong families and better opportunities for the next generation.

Just as poverty and entitlements can lead to a cycle of government dependency, education and opportunity can lead to a cycle of success and independence. I have seen this play out time and again with the families I have taken care of in my practice.
